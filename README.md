# Ryans_Portfolio

## Description

I was motivated in making this portfolio so potential employer's could see my work and skill level. My goal was to make a visually apealing website that was easy to naviagte. Throughout this challenge I learned a lot about css and what certain things do better than before. But overall my knowledge in CSS is severely lacking and I took this as my most valuable learning experience. That I need to watch more videos and read more articles on CSS so that when I go to make a new portfolio website I will not feel this way again and have a better time making it.
